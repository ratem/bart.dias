1.  **Parser (`bdias_parser.py`):**
    *   Identifies `for` loops, `while` loops, and nested loops.
    *   Identifies function definitions, recursive function calls, function calls within other functions, and loops calling functions.
    *   Identifies list comprehensions.
    *   Performs basic parallelizability checks (dependency, globals).
    *   Returns the full code block for functions and loops for later analysis.
2.  **Code Generator (`bdias_code_gen.py`):**
    *   Receives structured code from the parser.
    *   Generates basic, template-based code suggestions using `multiprocessing` for loops, nested loops, functions, and list comprehensions.
    *   Provides placeholder suggestions for `while` loops and recursive functions.
    *   Correctly handles different opportunity types identified by the parser.
    *   LLM integration is currently skipped (`get_llm_suggestion` returns "").
3.  **Assistant (`bdias_assist.py`):**
    *   Handles user interaction (console input for code string or file path).
    *   Orchestrates calls to the parser and code generator.
    *   Displays opportunities sorted by line number, along with explanations, partitioning suggestions, original code line, and generated code suggestions.
    *   Handles file reading.
4.  **Main (`main.py`):** Sets up the components and runs the interactive session.
5.  **Test (`bdias_test.py`):** Includes basic tests for parser and code generator instantiation.
6.  **Sample Code (`teste.py`):** Contains various constructs to test the parser.
