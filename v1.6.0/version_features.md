Bart.dIAs 1.6.0 is a Python assistant that analyzes code to identify and suggest parallelization opportunities using the multiprocessing module. Based on the current implementation, it offers the following capabilities:

## Core Functionality

- Parses Python code using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis
- Identifies various code constructs that can be parallelized
- Performs dependency analysis to determine parallelization safety
- Generates code suggestions with multiprocessing implementations
- Provides explanations and partitioning suggestions for each opportunity


## Pattern Recognition

Bart.dIAs can detect the following parallelizable patterns:

- Basic for loops
- While loops (with appropriate caveats)
- Nested loops with varying depths
- Functions with minimal side effects
- Recursive functions
- Function calls within other functions
- List comprehensions


## Advanced Pattern Detection

The system can also identify more complex "combo" patterns:

- For loops with recursive function calls
- While loops containing for loops
- For loops inside while loops
- Loops calling functions that themselves contain loops


## Dependency Analysis

Bart.dIAs performs sophisticated dependency analysis:

- Builds dependency graphs between variables
- Detects read-after-write dependencies
- Tracks cross-function dependencies
- Analyzes recursive call dependencies
- Identifies loop-carried dependencies


## Code Generation

For each identified opportunity, Bart.dIAs generates:

- Appropriate multiprocessing code templates
- Explanations of the parallelization opportunity
- Partitioning suggestions based on the pattern type
- Implementation notes and best practices

The tool provides an interactive interface where users can input Python code or file paths, and receive detailed parallelization suggestions with explanations and code examples.
