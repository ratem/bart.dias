# Current limitations

Based on the current state of Bart.dIAs (version 1.9.0).

## Current Capabilities in Bart.dIAs 1.9.0

### Phase 1: Pattern Recognition Framework

- **Partial Implementation**: Bart.dIAs currently has basic pattern recognition capabilities through its parser module (`BDiasParser`), which can identify:
    - Basic loops (for, while)
    - Nested loops
    - Functions (regular and recursive)
    - List comprehensions
    - Various "combo" patterns (e.g., for loops with recursive calls, while loops containing for loops)
- **Missing**: The system lacks a formal Pattern Characteristic Matrix that systematically maps computational structures to specific parallel patterns like Pipeline, Stencil, Master-Worker, etc.


### Phase 2: Domain Partitioning Framework

- **Partial Implementation**: The critical path analysis module (`BDiasCriticalPathAnalyzer`) implements theoretical work-span analysis based on Träff's book, which provides some foundation for understanding partitioning.
- **Missing**: Bart.dIAs doesn't yet have a formal framework for identifying and recommending specific partitioning strategies (SDP, TDP, SIP, TIP, etc.) based on data structures and access patterns.


### Phase 3: Pattern-Partitioning Compatibility Matrix

- **Not Implemented**: The system currently doesn't have a compatibility matrix or rules for matching patterns with appropriate partitioning techniques.


### Phase 4: Static Analysis Tools

- **Implemented**:
    - Code structure analysis through the parser module
    - Dependency analysis for detecting data flow and control dependencies
    - Critical path analysis for theoretical performance metrics
- **Partially Implemented**:
    - Pattern recognition engine (limited to basic structures)
- **Missing**:
    - Partitioning strategy recommender


### Phase 5: Integrated Analysis Framework

- **Partially Implemented**:
    - The system has a workflow that takes sequential code as input and identifies parallelization opportunities
    - It provides side-by-side code comparisons showing original and parallelized versions
    - The critical path analysis provides theoretical metrics (T₁, T∞, parallelism)
- **Missing**:
    - Recommendations for specific pattern-partitioning combinations
    - Trade-off analysis between different parallelization approaches


### Phase 6: Validation and Refinement

- **Partially Implemented**:
    - The system has test code examples for validation
- **Missing**:
    - Comprehensive benchmark suite for different patterns
    - Systematic validation process


## Specific Pattern Recognition Capabilities

Bart.dIAs can currently identify:

1. **Map-like Patterns**: Through detection of independent loops and list comprehensions
2. **Fork-Join Pattern**: Through detection of nested loops and function calls
3. **Basic Recursive Patterns**: Through detection of recursive functions

However, it doesn't yet explicitly identify:

1. Pipeline patterns
2. Stencil patterns
3. Master-Worker patterns
4. Reduction patterns
5. Scatter-Gather patterns

## Specific Partitioning Capabilities

The current critical path analysis provides theoretical foundations for understanding:

- Total work (T₁)
- Critical path length (T∞)
- Inherent parallelism (T₁/T∞)
- Sequential bottlenecks

But it doesn't yet provide specific recommendations for:

- Spatial Data Partitioning (SDP)
- Temporal Data Partitioning (TDP)
- Spatial Instruction Partitioning (SIP)
- Temporal Instruction Partitioning (TIP)
- Horizontal/Vertical/Hash Partitioning


## Summary

Bart.dIAs 1.9.0 has implemented:

- Basic pattern detection for common code structures
- Theoretical analysis of parallelism potential through critical path analysis
- Code generation for parallelization using multiprocessing
- Side-by-side comparison of original and parallelized code

The system needs to be extended to:

1. Explicitly identify higher-level parallel patterns (Pipeline, Stencil, etc.)
2. Recommend specific domain partitioning techniques
3. Provide a compatibility matrix between patterns and partitioning strategies
4. Offer more sophisticated trade-off analysis and recommendations

The critical path analysis module provides a solid theoretical foundation based on Träff's work, but needs to be connected to specific pattern recognition and partitioning recommendation capabilities to fully implement the proposed action plan.
